Best thing is to install PyCharm IDE. That lets you set breakpoints and debug in gui.

often you will need to install python packages (if you are getting some library open source). It is good to learn how to install packages.

On windows, in the past I had cygwin installed which comes with unix like interface

and a lot of packages like python etc.
